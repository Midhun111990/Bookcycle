# Bookcycle
Book Cycling System is a system which maintains the information
about the books available in the library, their authors, the members of library to
whom books are issued, library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize
manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task.
Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library
becomes much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to
computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the
members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of
library helps in many instances. It reduces the workload of
management as most of the manual work done is reduced.Library management system helps the libraries to keep the track of their documents. It is helpful for assisting a librarian in managing library activities. It manages, monitoring and controllinga library. Book Cycling System is a real life oriented and practical project based on location of the project. This help in reuse of the unused books by the wanted. Books are considered as the fundamental block of knowledge. So, the project also help in spreading the knowledge. By this application we are intending to build book related information system.
